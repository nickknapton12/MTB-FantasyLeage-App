# Mountain Bike Fantasy App
[See it here](https://dazzling-curran-ec76a5.netlify.app/)
**Unfortunately only optimised for desktop currently**

## READ
This is only the client side of the app. The backend is not public on github for now, however it is hosted and the client can interact with it!

It is branded with pinkbike logos aswell as logos from "sponsors". This is **just for proof of concept**, this is in no way associated with any of these companys, it is just a personal project I built and wanted to build it as if I was making it for pinkbike.

## Motivation
This is a Fantasy Sports app for my favorite sport, mountain biking! As far as I know as of making this (April 2021) this has never been done before, the closest is [Pinkbike Fanatsy League](https://www.pinkbike.com/contest/fantasy/dh/) however in my opinion it needed alot of work to be on the level as a typical fantasy sport website (currently pinkbikes is essentially a very basic form). 

## About
It is built off the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Reactjs, Nodejs), it features login and signup with password encryption using bcryptjs, JWT tokens, aswell as all the functionality you would expect from a fantasy sport site (joining and creating leagues, teams, rankings, news, results, etc)! The backend has easy ability to add more riders to choose from, the app can easily be updated to include more news and results and after a race can have the ability to update everyones score and display the proper rankings in the rankings area.

The front end is hosted with netifly, the backend is on heroku and the database is hosted with mongodb atlas.

## To do
* Make mobile friendly aswell as different screen sizes.
